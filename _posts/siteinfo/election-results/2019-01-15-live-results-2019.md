There are two community-run websites that have a list of candidates as well as the live results.

* [dexstats.info live results](https://dexstats.info/votelist.php)
* [VOTE explorer rich list](https://vote2.kmdexplorer.io/richlist)

You may vote by simply sending VOTE tokens to the candidate you wish to vote for.
